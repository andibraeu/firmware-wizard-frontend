# Frontend of the firmware wizard [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/freifunk-berlin/firmware-wizard-frontend.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/freifunk-berlin/firmware-wizard-frontend) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/freifunk-berlin/firmware-wizard-frontend.svg)](https://gemnasium.com/freifunk-berlin/firmware-wizard-frontend)

Currently, this is a prototype for an upcoming firmware wizard. Check it out [here](https://freifunk-berlin.github.io/firmware-wizard-frontend/)!

## Technical background
This wizards follows a few principles:

1. Router configuration should be a piece of cake (for users *and* developers).
2. Make the router stupid: all business logic is in the browser. Lua and LuCI can be removed from the router.
3. The actual router config is generated from a single-source-of-truth JSON config.
4. The wizard can be re-run with the JSON config.
5. Migrations to new versions of the firmware can regenerate the actual config from the JSON config.

## Development
You need `npm` (included in NodeJS) and `bower` (`npm install -g bower`).

The dependencies are fetched via
```
npm install
bower install
```

### Dev builds

The following command builds the required files for development purposes
in the subdirectory `dist` and spawns a web server on `http://localhost:8080`
(with live reload when you change files in `src/`):
```
npm run watch
```

### Production builds

A production build (with minification) is triggered via
```
npm run build
```
The resulting files are also placed in `dist/` so it may be worthwhile to run
```
npm run clean && npm run build
```
instead.
